LinkedIn is OK for gathering your professional profile together but over time I've contributed several industry articles and would like to put them into collections by topic. 

![I was lucky to help work on marketing and promtion of FPGAs like Lattice's "Do-It-All MachXO Family]({{ troypdx.github.io }}/assets/latticemachxo.jpg)

Here's the first collection of articles on FPGA and programmable design best practices:

 - [Optimizing FPGA Design Flow - Chip Design][optimizingfpga]
 - [Legacy FPGA Designs can be Migrated to Achieve Better Performance - ChipDesign][legacyfpga]
 - [Tackle Team-Based FPGA Design - Embedded][teamfpga]
 - [FPGA Performance and Design Constraints - Electronic Product Design][fpgacontraints]
 - [Power Saving Measures for Programmable Logic Designers][lowpowerpld]
 - [Programmable Power Circuits Improve Reliablity, Cut Cost][programmablepower]
